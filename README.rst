This is a work-in-progress library to interact with Rocket.Chat_ using
websockets (the "realtime API").

The main goal is to be able to build an XMPP client bridge that doesnâ€™t
require webhooks or admin rights, and that appears as a normal XMPP
chatroom (e.g. ``#general%demo.rocket.chat@my.xmpp.server``), in the same
spirit as biboumi_.

Currently, nothing works (experimenting the desired level of abstraction).

Thanks

Many things were found out from reading the source of purple-rocketchat_, so
I want to thank its author for taking the time to write the plugin.
