Message toplevel
================

- Everything received is a message (is of the shape ``{'msg': 'something'}``.
- Except the useless ``{'server-id': 0}`` at the beginning.

Message types
-------------

- ``ping`` - frequently received - reply with ``{'msg': 'pong'}``
- ``connected`` - received after connecting
- ``ready`` - received after subscribing to an event
- ``result`` - result of a remote method call

- ``added`` - things added to a collection (seen so far: own user, kadira debugging stuff)
- ``changed`` - about everything else (new messages, joins, room events, etc)
- ``removed`` - removed stuff

- ``error`` - error


Collections for the "changed" type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Those are all notifications you have to subscribe to.
All the notifications have an ``id`` attribute that is set to ``"id"``
for some reason.
